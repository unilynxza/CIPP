# PasswordPusher

Password Push integration allows you to generate password links instead of plain text passwords. Configure authentication and expiration settings that will apply to all generated passwords. 
If you are a Hosted PWPush Pro customer you can also select an account for branding if you enable Bearer Authentication. 
Self-Hosted must use the Email Address and API Key method for authenticated pushes.
